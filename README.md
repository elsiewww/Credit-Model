Delinquency Prediction Model
Objectives:
Develop a model to predict consumer default
based on machine learning. Our model predicts
favorable creditworthiness for individuals with
subpar FICO scores. We believe such a model
would be helpful in the bankâ€™s policies design to
reduce customer default and accelerate the credit
scoring efficiency. Below are some main challenges in this model
1. Data resource
2. Feature Selection
3. Machine Learning model
